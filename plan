* Detect evil strings like </script> and </style> inside the inline code
* Implement support for "global" params (for setting nocompress for a bunch of files for example)
* When concatenating, take params into account so not a single file is produced at all times
  - Or rather, give an error message in that case
* Include images inline in css
* Parameter to output tags valid accoring to different doctypes (html5, xhtml, html-transitional etc)
* Test assetRoot
* Test all kinds of errors that can occur
* For every parameter "x" there should also be "always-x" and "never-x". Those will override anything set in build/serve.
  - inline (global and local)
  - compress (global and local)
  - paths (global and local)
  - concat (only global)
* Should be possible to add a timestamp in the names of the generated files
* Write tests for files that are written to the filesystem rather than printed on stdout
