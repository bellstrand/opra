Implemented but not thoroughly or not tested
============================================
* Test assetRoot
* Test all kinds of errors that can occur


Core changes
============
* Generalize the parser so it can handle any kind of parameters
* Improve the build.js-code so it's possible to understand what it's doing
* Rename all hooks so they're purpose becomes explicit


Hooks
=====
* Include images inline in css
* Parameter to output tags valid accoring to different doctypes (html5, xhtml, html-transitional etc)
  - Even better if this is detected automatically from the html-file
* Should be possible to add a timestamp in the names of the generated files
* Include files remotely (http/https). Cache them so they dont have to be downloaded all the time.
* Add caching for all compilation/compression so files that have not changed can be served faster
