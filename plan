Implemented but not thoroughly or not tested
============================================
* Test assetRoot
* Test all kinds of errors that can occur


Not implemented
===============
* Include images inline in css
* Parameter to output tags valid accoring to different doctypes (html5, xhtml, html-transitional etc)
  - Even better if this is detected automatically from the html-file
* Should be possible to add a timestamp in the names of the generated files
* Add the possibility to write HTML-comments that will be removed from the final output
* Include files remotely (http/https). Cache them so they dont have to be downloaded all the time.
* Add line numbers to as many error messages as possible
* Add some kind of caching for NPM-tags (browserify has a cache-flag. investiagte.)
* Add caching for all compilation/compression so files that have not changed can be served faster
* Add aliases for NPM-tags (as:$ as:jQuery as:async and so on)
